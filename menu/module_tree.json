We also look at the degrees of the graph, what they represent, and some important theorems that can describe the graph. Lastly, we look into the concept of isomorphism and how it is applied in graph theory.",

Notably, we explain the First Theorem of Graph Theory and its proof. We also explain the concept of a graph's diameter, and even/odd vertices."

Not all sequences of numbers are degree sequences (i.e. represent a graph). Because of this, we explore the Havel-Hakimi Algorithm - a procedure for determining if a sequence of numbers represents the degrees of a graph."
