We also look at the degrees of the graph, what they represent, and some important theorems that can describe the graph. Lastly, we look into the concept of isomorphism and how it is applied in graph theory.",

Not all sequences of numbers are degree sequences (i.e. represent a graph). Because of this, we explore the Havel-Hakimi Algorithm - a procedure for determining if a sequence of numbers represents the degrees of a graph."
